                Pashupatinath Temple is a Hindu temple located on the banks of the Bagmati River in the city of Kathmandu, Nepal. It is one of the most sacred Hindu temples in the world and is dedicated to Lord Shiva, who is worshipped here in the form of Pashupati, the "Lord of Animals."</p>
                <p>The history of Pashupatinath Temple dates back to the 5th century AD, when a small temple was built at the site. The temple was later expanded and renovated by various rulers over the centuries, including the Licchavi king, Prachanda Deva, in the 7th century, and later by the Malla kings in the 17th century.</p>
                <p>The temple complex covers an area of 246 acres and includes a main temple, numerous smaller shrines and ashrams, and a cremation ground where Hindus are traditionally cremated. The main temple is a two-tiered pagoda-style structure with gold-tipped roofs and four main doors, which are made of silver and carved with images of various Hindu deities.</p>
                <p>The interior of the temple is richly decorated with carvings and sculptures, and houses a black stone lingam, or phallic symbol, which represents Lord Shiva. The temple also has a number of other important shrines, including the Guhyeshwari Temple, dedicated to the goddess Parvati, and the Dakshin Kali Temple, dedicated to the goddess Kali.</p>
                <p>Pashupatinath Temple is not only a place of worship, but also an important cultural and social hub for the Hindu community in Nepal. The temple attracts millions of pilgrims and tourists from around the world every year, particularly during the annual Maha Shivaratri festival, when thousands of devotees gather to offer prayers and seek blessings from Lord Shiva. The temple was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.</p>
