        <p>Boudhanath, also known as Boudha, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Kathmandu, Nepal. It is one of the largest stupas in the world and is an important pilgrimage site for Tibetan Buddhists and Nepalis.</p>

        <p>The stupa is believed to have been built in the 14th century by the Malla kings of Nepal. It is said that the stupa was built on the site where Kassapa Buddha's remains were buried. Legend has it that a woman named Jadzima, who was a devout follower of the Buddha, requested the king to build the stupa. The king agreed and offered Jadzima a piece of land on which to build the stupa. The construction of the stupa took several years and was completed by the king's successor.</p>
            
        <p>Over the centuries, Boudhanath has undergone several renovations and restorations. The most recent renovation was carried out after the 2015 earthquake, which caused significant damage to the stupa. The renovation was completed in 2016, and the stupa was reopened to the public.</p>
            
        <p>Boudhanath is an important pilgrimage site for Tibetan Buddhists and Nepalis. Every year, thousands of devotees visit the stupa to offer their prayers and perform rituals. The stupa is surrounded by numerous monasteries, and the area around the stupa is known as Little Tibet due to the large number of Tibetan refugees who have settled there.</p>
            
        <p>The stupa has a large white dome that is topped by a square structure painted with the eyes of the Buddha. The dome represents the earth, while the square structure represents the four elements of fire, air, water, and earth. The eyes of the Buddha are said to symbolize the wisdom and compassion of the Buddha.</p>
            
    </p>Overall, Boudhanath is an important cultural and religious site in Nepal, and it attracts visitors from all over the world who come to marvel at its beauty and spiritual significance.</p>
