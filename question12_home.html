<!-- Design a website for the Tourism Sites of a given City. There should be at least 15 web-pages present 
in the web-site. There should be:
 One Home page that leads to other pages. The Home page should contain the name of the City 
as heading along with a logo. There should be a tab with the following links:
 Home;
 Heritage;
 Hotel Booking;
 Gallery.
One Heritage page which contains a list of all the Heritage Sites present in the city. The list 
should be a list of Pictures. There should be a minimum of ten heritage sites. Each Image entry 
in the list should be a HTML link/button that leads to a web-page totally dedicated to the 
Heritage Site itself.
Each Heritage Site should have its own dedicated web-page. This page should contain a 
description about the site along with its history.
The Hotel booking page basically contains a form that a person needs to fill up in order to stay 
in a hotel. The form should ask all the necessary questions using appropriate form elements.
 One gallery page that contains set of photos taken of the Heritage Sites throughout the city.
Please note that each web-page in this website should have the same background Image/color. 
The looks of each page should be similar -->
