            The MA English courses offer students insights into literature, language, culture, and history. Besides studying the required core courses that reflect the nature of the discipline, students will have the flexibility of selecting courses from different areas such as language, literature, rhetoric, and humanities. While retaining the fundamental philosophy of humanistic education, this syllabus aims at developing students' creative, critical, and communicative skills that they need in their academic and professional life. Focus on writing, intensive study of literary genres, emphasis on interpretive and cultural theories, and the incorporation of interdisciplinary and comparative study are some of the underlying features of the courses. The syllabus requires a participatory and inquiry-based pedagogy for effective teaching and learning.

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>The syllabus reflects the current trends in English Studies that have radically expanded the scope of the discipline. Taking into account the curriculum models adopted in many universities across the world, it recognizes and draws upon multiple traditions, communities, and literatures. The syllabus, therefore, comprises of a productive mix of canonical and non-canonical texts, traditionally-recognized literary and semi-literary genres, and expressive artifacts from multiple cultural traditions. The goal is to enable students to read, interpret and critique texts in a wide range of modes, genres and media. The syllabus, hence, envisions the following general objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>to realign the canons and methods,</li>
                <li> to stress interrelationship among literary criticism, theory and cultural studies, to foster critical and creative thinking,</li>
                <li>to promote research in the humanities,</li>
                <li>  to give exposure to a wide range of global literary texts, and to introduce area studies.</li>
            </ul>
