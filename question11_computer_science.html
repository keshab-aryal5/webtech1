                The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Information Technology (BScCSIT) curriculum is designed by closely following the courses practiced in accredited international universities, subject to the condition that the intake students are twelve years of schooling in the science stream or equivalent from any university recognized by Tribhuvan University (TU). In addition to the foundation and core Computer Science and Information Technology courses, the program offers several elective courses to fulfill the demand of high technology applications development. The foundation and core courses are designed to meet the undergraduate academic program requirement, and the service courses are designed to meet the need of fast changing computer technology and application. Students enrolled in the four year BScCSIT program are required to take courses in design and implementation of computer software systems, foundation in the theoretical model of computer science, and a functional background of computer hardware. All undergraduate students are required to complete 126 credit hours of computer science course and allied courses.
